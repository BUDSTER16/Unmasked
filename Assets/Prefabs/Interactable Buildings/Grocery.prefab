    - Financier has contacts in the government, he had them push to cut "frivolous"
      spending and with it, my stipend for heroics.
    - I need groceries for tonight but as of now, there's just no way I can afford
      them.
    - I had to save the city... right?
  releasedDialogue:

    dialogueText:
    - The major bank in our city went under suddenly due to Financier's crimes.
    - Most clients are unable to withdraw any money and everyone is just waiting
      on a court settlement.
    - I knew what was happening... I took my money out right after letting him go...
    - Half the grocery store was looted already by starving people with no access
      to their money.
    - I could have stopped this...

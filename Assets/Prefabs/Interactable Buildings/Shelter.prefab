    - The local homeless only has a tarp as a roof, but it's better than nothing
      when it rains.
    - The job market is so rough right now, the shelter is always over capacity.
    - I need to help out more often.
  quest: 1
  stoppedDialogue:
    dialogueName: Brennan
    dialogueText:
    - I like to help out where I can in the community, that's why I volunteer to
      cook meals every so often for the homeless.
    - Tonight didn't go to plan at all though, about halfway through, I was pulled
      aside and escorted into the back.
    - I saw what all the commotion was about, Pseudo released a video detailing how
      his powers were stolen from him by Digisword.
    - The video then went on to name a bunch of fake people, as well as myself, as
      accomplices of The Boss himself.
    - I was told to leave, as I made my way out, food was thrown at me repeatedly
      by most people.
    - Someone even tried to stab me, which I barely avoided without using my powers.
  releasedDialogue:
    dialogueName: Brennan
    dialogueText:
    - The tarp roof was torn and the whole shelter, flooded, no doubt the work of
      Pseudo.
    - He continued to make himself look like a hero, fighting fake villains of his
      own creation in places chosen to do maximum damage.
    - Businesses were destroyed causing mass homelessness, however the shelters were
      destroyed as well.
    - How could I have let this happen...
